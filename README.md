## Welcome!
If you are programming, you are at the right place. This repo contains all of our team code for the 2025-2026 season.

## Requirements
To use this Android Studio project, you will need Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2) or later. You can download it for Windows, macOS, Linux, or ChromeOS* here: https://developer.android.com/studio
(*)=ChromeOS device must be compataible with the Linux development environment (found in settings) and allow for it (the allowing part only applies to managed Chromebooks, like school Chromebooks.)

## Getting Started
If you are new to robotics or new to the *FIRST* Tech Challenge, then you should consider reviewing the [FTC Blocks Tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html) to get familiar with how to use the control system:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[FTC Blocks Online Tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html)

Even if you are an advanced Java programmer, it is helpful to start with the [FTC Blocks tutorial](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/blocks/Blocks-Tutorial.html), and then migrate to the [OnBot Java Tool](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/onbot_java/OnBot-Java-Tutorial.html) or to [Android Studio](https://ftc-docs.firstinspires.org/programming_resources/android_studio_java/Android-Studio-Tutorial.html) afterwards.

## Downloading the Project
If you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo.

* If you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone https://github.com/eeimont1/FTC-11241-Blue-Steel.git</p>

* Or, if you prefer, you can use the "Download Zip" button available through the main repository page.  Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").

### Sample OpModes
This project contains a large selection of Sample OpModes from the FTC SDK (robot code examples) which can be cut and pasted into our /TeamCode folder to be used as-is, or modified.

Samples Folder: &nbsp;&nbsp; [/FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples](FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotcontroller/external/samples)

The readme.md file located in the [/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode](TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode) folder contains an explanation of the sample naming convention, and instructions on how to copy them to our project space.
